# IMO 2000, Problem 5

Does there exist a positive integer `n` such that `n` has exactly 2000 prime divisors
and `n` divides `2^n + 1`?

**Answer:** Yes.

**Proof Strategy (Inductive Construction):**
We will show that for any `k ≥ 1`, there exists such an `n` with `k` distinct prime factors.

1.  **Base Case (k=1):** Let `n₁ = 3`. It has one prime factor (3) and `3 ∣ 2³ + 1 = 9`.

2.  **Inductive Step:** Assume we have `nₖ` with `k` distinct prime factors satisfying `nₖ ∣ 2^(nₖ) + 1`.
    We construct `nₖ₊₁` by finding a new prime `p` not in the factors of `nₖ`.

3.  **Core Lemma:** If `n > 1` and `n ∣ 2ⁿ + 1`, then there exists a prime `p` such that `p ∤ n`
    and `n * p ∣ 2^(n*p) + 1`.

A prime factor `p` of `2^n + 1` must be greater than `n`, for `n > 1`.
This is a key step in finding a new prime factor. It uses the concept of the order of an element.

/--
For any `n > 1` satisfying the condition, we can find a new prime `p`
that divides `2^n + 1` but does not divide `n`.
This is the heart of the inductive step. It works by showing that `2^n + 1` must have a prime
factor that is not a factor of `n`, because `2^n + 1 > n`.
